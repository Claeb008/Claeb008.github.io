	<p style="padding-left: 5%"><br>Help:<br>If your running on a low resolution screen please use the fullscreen button to make sure you see everything.<br><br>Need Help With Levels?<br>Level 1: You can walk on pressure plates to activate them and buttons sometimes need to be revealed first.<br>Level 2: Pick the magnet up of the wall by using "Right Shift." Then the magnetic cube can be pulled by pressing "E" if you are in range, and be pushed by pressing "Q."<br>Level 3: Sometimes pressure plates are activated when objects are over them, not players.<br>Level 4: Once you have the timeglass, use "E" to go forward in time, and "Q" to go backward in time. Tip: The door breaks down over time.<br>Level 5: Press "F" to access your inventory and click the magnet icon with your mouse. Mirrors are magnetic. You want to hit the bulb on the end of the pole with the laser.<br>Level 6: When the eyebat is in range he can hurt you with the lightning attack. His lightning attack can burn wood objects. If your health drops to zero, the current level your on will restart.<br>Level 7: If one spider touches you, you will lose half a heart of health. Be Quick! You have been granted 5 health potions in your inventory which can be used with "E." If your health does not show up after you respawn, use the health potion and press "Q" a few times until the level restarts, it should be fixed then.<br>Level 8: If you move close to the laser source, a slider will apear allowing you to control the angle of the laser.<br>Level 9: Once you have revealed the stone eyebat, you can go back in time to when he was alive and the stone rubble was not there. Creatures will stop moving and freeze while you go through time. Bring the eyebat with you along the path because you will need him to get the key. Once you have the key, go to the boss door and press "E."<br>Level 10: The Stone Golem will hit you at very high velocities, some objects will break under those high velocities. Make sure to use health potions to stay alive! Or find a weak spot...<br>Falling: Use.. the.. time.. glass..<br><br>Credits:<br>Paperwork: Andrew MacRae &amp; Caleb Early<br>Programming: Caleb Early<br>Pixel Art/Graphics: Caleb Early &amp; Andrew MacRae &amp; Vale Tolar<br>Music: Vale Tolar<br>Sound Effects: Andrew MacRae<br><br>This game was made with the Unity Game Engine and the C# programming language.
